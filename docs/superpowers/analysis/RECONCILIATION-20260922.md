# Selective upstream reconciliation — 2026-09-22

This is the durable execution record for the reconciliation goal. It is kept in
the candidate worktree only; the protected baseline is never edited.

## Source snapshot

| role | ref | value |
|---|---|---|
| candidate worktree | `port/inferno-selective-upstream-20260922` | `8aa1e5de0253e8a99a9e58d19cf5d33caa8ec56d` |
| protected baseline | `baseline/gpt-live-working-20260922` | `7d3a6099bfa5d14d95253de7ac1864a9b330040e` |
| upstream | `upstream/main` | `1c0a69c0ceddb2fd21581c17ab09f6c500b89ba1` |
| rollback tag | `checkpoint/pre-reconciliation-8aa1e5de0` | candidate HEAD before this run |

The candidate was clean before this checkpoint. The protected baseline has
pre-existing untracked runtime artifacts; they are intentionally left alone.

## Current inventory

The current `upstream-daily.mjs --no-fetch` report covers the watermark window
starting at `5097b3145` and contains 406 non-empty upstream commits:

| provisional route | count | meaning before review |
|---|---:|---|
| `MERGE` | 254 | backend/mirror or other changes; inspect ancestry and behavior |
| `VERBATIM` | 5 | candidate route says the product copy is untouched |
| `NEW` | 11 | candidate route says no product counterpart exists |
| `REBUILD` | 136 | candidate route says the product copy carries June changes |

These are routing hints, not completion claims. Each commit must receive a
final `TAKE`, `HAND-MERGE`, or `SKIP` disposition with affected paths,
rationale, and observed verification evidence.

The broader candidate-to-upstream graph still has 561 upstream commits that
are not ancestors of the candidate. That graph fact is not a reason to bulk
merge: the candidate contains intentional OAuth, GPT Live, sideband, billing,
and June-product divergence.

## Execution lanes

1. **Backend non-core:** schema/migrations, provider compatibility, and
   admin/ops/domain changes with explicit path ownership.
2. **Upstream mirror/contracts:** only `frontend/**`; this mirror is kept
   current and is not the June product.
3. **June product:** only `inferno-frontend/**`; existing converted files are
   hand-merged and genuinely new counterparts are built in June idiom.
4. **Serial core/integration:** gateway/WS, OAuth replay, failover, billing,
   account continuation, merges, and final verification.

No two lanes may write the same file. `design-system/tokens` and
`design-system/components` remain protected unless a reviewed requirement
proves otherwise.

## Checkpoint protocol

Every integrated phase must record:

- branch/worktree and resulting commit;
- upstream source commits and final disposition;
- affected paths and why they were selected;
- commands actually run and exit status;
- remaining unreviewed rows and blockers.

The upstream watermark is not advanced until the candidate's backend and
pristine mirror are current and every selected row has evidence. A session or
usage interruption resumes from the latest passing checkpoint rather than
starting a second writer.
